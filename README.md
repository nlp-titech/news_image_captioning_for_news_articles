# Image Caption Generation for News Articles 

This repository contains the code for our COLING 2020 paper [Image Caption Generation for News Articles](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.176.pdf). 

In this paper, we address the task of news-image captioning, which generates a description of
an image given the image and its article body as input. This task is more challenging than the
conventional image captioning, because it requires a joint understanding of image and text. We
present a Transformer model that integrates text and image modalities and attends to textual features from visual features in generating a caption. Experiments based on automatic evaluation
metrics and human evaluation show that an article text provides primary information to reproduce news-image captions written by journalists. The results also demonstrate that the proposed
model outperforms the state-of-the-art model. In addition, we also confirm that visual features
contribute to improving the quality of news-image captions.
